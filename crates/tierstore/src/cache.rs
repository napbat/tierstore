//! A tiered read-through cache built **on top of** the generic router.
//!
//! This layer is deliberately thin: [`Router`](crate::Router) is the
//! mechanism, [`Policy`] the semantics, and the cache contributes
//! cache-appropriate defaults — exclusive promotion
//! ([`Promote::TopOnly`]) plus demotion-on-evict, i.e. the classic
//! *rollover* hierarchy where an entry evicted from hot rolls into warm
//! instead of vanishing.
//!
//! Stampede protection is built in: concurrent `get`s for the same key
//! coalesce into one fill (per-key single-flight, adopted from shardstore's
//! `ArtifactCache`). Cache-only concerns still to come: per-tier
//! TTL/staleness and negative caching.
