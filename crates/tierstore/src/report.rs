//! Per-key outcome reports for batched router operations.
//!
//! A batch can partially succeed: some keys hit, some are confirmed absent,
//! and — when a tier fails mid-batch — some are simply unknown. Collapsing
//! that into a single `Result` either lies about the unknown keys or throws
//! away the resolved ones, so these report types keep one status per key
//! alongside whatever tier failures occurred.
